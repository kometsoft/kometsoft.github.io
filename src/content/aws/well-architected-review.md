## AWS Well-Architected Review

Ensure your AWS workloads are built on solid foundations. Our Well-Architected Review service helps you identify risks and opportunities for improvement across six pillars of architectural excellence.

### The Six Pillars

#### 1. Operational Excellence
The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures.

**We Review:**
- Infrastructure as Code practices
- Monitoring and observability
- Incident response procedures
- Change management processes
- Deployment practices

#### 2. Security
The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.

**We Review:**
- Identity and access management
- Detective controls
- Infrastructure protection
- Data protection
- Incident response capability

#### 3. Reliability

**We Review:**
- Workload architecture
- Change management
- Failure management
- Backup and recovery
