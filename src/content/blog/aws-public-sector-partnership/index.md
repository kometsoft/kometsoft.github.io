We are excited to announce that Kometsoft has been awarded as an AWS Public Sector Partner. This recognition highlights our expertise and success in providing innovative solutions to government and educational organizations using the Amazon Web Services platform.

As a member of the AWS Public Sector Partner Program, we are committed to helping our clients modernize their operations, improve security, and drive efficiencies using the latest AWS technologies.

This is indeed a great opportunity for Kometsoft alongside with the promotion to AWS Select Tier Services partner status which we received recently.

We look forward to continuing to serve the public sector and helping our clients achieve their mission-critical goals.

Sincerely,
